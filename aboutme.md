I, Saumya Shinde, am a proud pet mom. My cat Viki has the following qualities:

- Adventurous
- Shares with her sister (sometimes)
- Loves sunshine
- Never meows unless asking for food.


### Sidenotes with Viki:

Viki would like you to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) for all the reasons why you should **not** adopt.
