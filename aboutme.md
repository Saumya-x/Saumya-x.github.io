title: Plane curves belong in the Math textbook, and women do not belong there.
subtitle: Feminism woven into CSCI 103 
---

I, Saumya Shinde, am a first-year from Mumbai, India at Williams College. I am a dialogue facilitator, conflict mediator, advocate, dancer, and an artist. You can read more about my work [here](https://www.seedsofpeace.org/meet-saumya-doing-the-most-good-with-3900-weeks/) 

One of my reasons, out of many, for partaking in this course is related to feminism. An ad in the 1950's by the *Hidden Treasures* brassiere company talks about how Plane curves belong in the Math textbook. Hitting two birds with one stone, it effectively translates into:
- A. Body shaming
- B. Womens' place (bodies) unbelonging in STEM.

I myself have had such a perception of my own skills in STEM. I am done running away from it. I want to dispel the story I have built for myself for years - "I just do not get it." I want to challenge myself in a **safe space**. Adding on to the feminist aspect, I am intrigued by the marriage of knitting and programming - both things I have not given myself the chance to fail (or succeed!) at. An experiential class at heart, I cannot wait to step out of my theory bubble and do, create, shape!
