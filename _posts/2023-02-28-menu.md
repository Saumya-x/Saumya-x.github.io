## **Assignment reflection**
For this assignment, we had to use nested if..else.. statements. There is the menu and then the secret menu (aka the odd menu) which are decided by either an even or odd integer input respectively. The readercan choose from meal options 1,2,3 and it will vary for both the menus. If the reader tries an input beyond 1,2,3 for meal options, then too an output should be ready to be delivered. 

Screnshot of one of the outputs!
