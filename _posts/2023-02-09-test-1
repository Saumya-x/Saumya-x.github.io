Demo Post from my cat!

{: .box-error}
**Disclaimer:** I am only talking through my experience. Every cat has their own way of spending their Sunday, and I do not represent the views of all cats, so becareful while drawing geenralizations for cats around the world.

## Here's a journal of a typical Sunday morning in my life:

| Time | Activity | Comments |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| 5 am | Playing with Saumya's hair| Fun |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| 5:30am | Successfully waking her up | She gets enough sleep already |
| 5:32am | Meowing loudly for food | My throat is hoarse |
| 5:33am | Ate some fish | Mission Accomplished! |
| 5:45am  | Saw a few birds outside my window | Frustrating to not be able to catch them |
| 6:15am |Played with my sister | She lacked energy today, maybe because I ate her share? |
| 7am | Went to the terrace | Fresh air! Open skies! |
| 8am | Came back home | Home sweet home |
| 9am | Meowed for treats | I like salmon flavored treats more than chicken one |
| 9:02am |Ate my treats | Need i say more? |
| 9:05am | Sun-bathing | Pools of sun forming on my fur, while I get pet by her |
| 3pm |Woke up!?| Did not realize I napped after my poetry|
