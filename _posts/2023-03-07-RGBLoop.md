## **Assignment reflection**
Using While function, we had to create the RGB Loop - three colors of LED lights (red, green, and blue) had to be displayed/printed, on the GP of 10, and each one had to be printed 3 times simultaneously before moving on to the next color. The runtime also had to be a changeable variable.
