## **Brief:**
Paper prototype is one of the first steps to starting the project, so I know exactly which components go into it and how. It is also helpful to have a larger picture of the project for debugging purposes later on. 
I decided to not do bus traces nor have all components on the wrong side. This decision was taken so as to enhance my project's structure, aesthetic, and messaging even more.

**Right side of the Prototype i.e component layout + non-conductive thread work:**

**Wrong side of the prototype i.e. circuit traces:**

### Tip/Trick for Past Saumya

{: .box-note}
**Note:** Think about what YOU want the final project to look like, not how you think it should should look like! Be realistic too, with the time and energy you have for this project. Get creative in utilizing the resources you already have and ask for help - FabLab, TAs, and Professor Howley!!
