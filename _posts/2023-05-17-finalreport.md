## **Project Description and Motivation**
I was inspired to do this Statement Art Piece from my WGSS passion and my recent training to be an Abortion Doula. Roe v Wade being overturned was shocking, and its ramifications will be felt globally as the influence of US is not to be taken lightly. Thus my project had an Uterus stitched with shiny black floss and pink floss onto a white felt. I used conductive thread to connect the Arduino circuit to the light sensor and the slide switch, Analog and Digital inputs respectively. The switch being on state enabled the red LEDs (digital output) to turn on. And only when both switch was on and light sensor was covered ie darkness was achieved, would the RGB LED (Analog output) flash shades of red since Roe v Wade has ben overturned. Glimpses of blue and green would show up in the shades of light blue and pink. It will be switched to shades of blue the day Roe v Wade is reinstated and will turn green the day global reproductive justice is achieved.

### Tips/Tricks for Past Saumya

{: .box-note}
**Note:** 1. Go to the FabLab and get better Fabric Glue and guidance for insulation; 2. Think critically where the component - especially the Arduino board – goes. Mirroring it was not a difficult task while stitching, but could have visualized the prototype better; 3. Circuits are not as intimidating as you think they are!! Just getting started is the trick; 4. You did well!!!<3
