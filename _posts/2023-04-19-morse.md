## **Assignment reflection**

When the circuit is open, the buzzer should play your morse code name, and when the circuit is closed, the buzzer should play morse code SOS!

### Fun Fact

On 10 June 1909, the 'SOS' signal was used in an emergency for the first time, when the Cunard liner SS Slavonia was wrecked off the Azores. Two steamers received her signals and went to the rescue.

### Tip/Trick for Past Saumya

{: .box-note}
**Note:** switchValue is going to be confusing and so is figuring out the delay between the letters within a word (especially for SOS!), so be prepared for that!
