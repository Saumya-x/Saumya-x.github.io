The assignment was exciting yet challenging! We had to stitch Lilypad Arduino components onto our textile and do additional embroidery as suited. A little plushie was the right amount of challenge. I was not entirely succesful at this, but had fun neverthless and understood the textile-circuit relationship better than before. Adding on the button and slide switch components to the circuit made it more complex and gave a control over the circuit.

## **Process**

Alligator Prototype!
*I had to get creative here, as most of my supplies got used up in the stitch (I took this photot after)*

### Tip/Trick for Past Saumya

**Note:** Start earlier and ask for help with the TAs. My plushie is not lighting up yet, but the process was informative!
