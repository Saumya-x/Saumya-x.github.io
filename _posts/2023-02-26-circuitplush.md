The assignment was exciting yet challenging! We had to stitch Lilypad Arduino components onto our textile and do additional embroidery as suited. A little plushie was the right amount of challenge. I was not entirely succesful at this, but had fun neverthless and understood the textile-circuit relationship better than before. Adding on the button and slide switch components to the circuit made it more complex and gave a control over the circuit.

Alligator Prototype!
*I had to get creative here, as most of my supplies got used up in the stitch (I took this photo after I was done, but had completed this step in the process at the rigtht time.)*
