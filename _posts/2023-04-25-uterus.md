## **Project Proposal:**
My WGSS classes and feminist endeavors till now have brought me to this project. It is using art as activism to counter the current reality. 
I recently became an Abortion Doula with the Berkshire Doula Project, and have been thinking about this for quite some time. My project will display the lack of agency those with uteruses have â€“ the stitching, lights, and battery by themselves are suffice for that statement. The red LEDs will symbolize the mesntrual blood, destigmatizing menstruation as a topic of conversation, which is still considered unholy back home. The RGB will be connected to the light sensor, which upon snesing darkness will light up with shades of red to show the danger of the overturning of Roe V Wade. Someday (hopefully soon), when it is reinstated, the RGB LED will be programmed to flash shades of Blue. And when Reproductive Justice is a reality over the globe, the RGB LED will be programmed to to flash shades of Green. I have outlined my circuit below (with an image!) to better explain my idea. 
It satisfies the requirements of 2 inputs and 2 outputs, and having one of each be an Analog one.
