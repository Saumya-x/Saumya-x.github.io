## Curious why I did it? Read on!
Basically, for an assignment.

But for CSCI 103 we will be programming with Lilypad Arduino, especially with the "if..else.." blocks. So this is good practice! Int Temperature is a changing variable, with any numerical input possibe. You put in the degree celsius temperature and with the help of "if...else..." blocks, the code will tell you how to dress up as an output. Here is an example below of the code.

**Note:** You did well this time! Try coding bit by bit though, try not to do whole blocks of them at once! >o<
