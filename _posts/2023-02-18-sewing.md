Frontside!
![Sampler with 9 different stitches]([(https://github.com/Saumya-x/Saumya-x.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/SEW1.jpeg?raw=true)){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Backside!
*I ended up stitching both the flaps of the cloth together for the whip stitch, so I can show the backside of the stitches in person as they cannot be captured by the camera.*

{: .box-note}
**Note:** *Advice to past Saumya*: Do not be in a haste. Enjoy the process. Also, do not go for shortcuts because that only leads to extra detangling work along with frustration >o<
