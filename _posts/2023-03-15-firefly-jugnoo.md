## **Project description**
We replicated the firefly flashes to code by using Arduino Board. Each firefly had its distinctive pattern which was described (visually) on the sheet provided with it. It was a project that required amalgamating and storing all the variables at the top and using if..else statements, &&, and while loop logic. 
## Photos of LEDs flashing (Working):

The FlashBulb 

*(Pin A5 flashes every 4s for 0.5s)*

The BigDipper 

*(Pin A7 flashes every 3s until max brightness at an increment of 30 every 0.1s)*

The Synchronous 

*(Pin A6 flashes every 10s for 0.2s in a consecutive 3-series flash which is separated by 0.1s each)*

This is what a transition between each reset looks like!

*Since pictures cannot capture the firefly behavior, take a peek at these videos here!*
