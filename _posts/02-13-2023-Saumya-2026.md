**Year of graduation:** 2026
**Potential Majors:** Psychology/Public Health

### My sewing experience?
I have only done craft in highschool. We had to stitch badminton racquet covers, aprons, and purses for a graded class. I never really paid attention though and had way too much theory in that class.

### My programming experience?
Not much. I have only created a website on Kajabi (and now this!) until now. I am excited though!!

I **hope** to learn sewing and programming of course, but I am more interested in the intersection of these 2 disciplines. This is a super novel fusion for me and I am excited for it. I am even more invested to be able to say at the end of the semester: "Yes, I can code and knit!" So, it is even more impertie about developing a growth mindset for myself. 

- One boring fact: I can control the movement of both of my eyebrows.
- One fun fact: My fingerprints cannot be traced (skin condition)!
