## **Assignment reflection**
For this assignment, we had to use nested if..else.. statements. Translating the plushie from a physically sewn object to a programming code was fun! Had to connect the LED values to button and switch being on. And then decide if the circuit was open or closed, what the response output would be.

**Note:** Try different approaches! Do not get attached to any one type of code, and keep striving for simplest one possible.
